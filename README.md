# Global-Terrorism-EDA
This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on global terrorism. The aim is to gain insights into patterns, trends, and factors associated with terrorist attacks worldwide.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1luTU7xBvI7QAGPbQMxEHcgKUi9d6UeP_/view). It provides comprehensive information on terrorist attacks from various sources, covering a wide range of variables including attack details, geographical locations, target types, and terrorist groups involved.

Analysis Steps
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducting statistical analysis and data visualization to explore key aspects of global terrorism.
Attack Patterns: Examining attack types, frequencies, and trends.
Geospatial Analysis: Mapping attack locations and identifying hotspots.
Target Analysis: Investigating target types and their vulnerabilities.
Casualty Analysis: Analyzing the impact of terrorist attacks in terms of casualties.
Terrorist Groups: Exploring the involvement of various terrorist organizations.
Insights and Conclusions: Summarizing key findings and implications.
Tools and Libraries
Python programming language
Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization
Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis
GeoPandas and Folium for geospatial analysis and mapping
Results and Findings
The EDA reveals valuable insights into global terrorism, including:

Distribution and trends of terrorist attacks across different regions and countries.
Most common attack types and their frequencies.
Geographical hotspots and regions affected by terrorism.
Vulnerable target types and sectors.
The impact of terrorist attacks in terms of casualties.
Identification of major terrorist groups and their activities.
Usage and Contributions
This project serves as a foundation for understanding the nature of global terrorism and can be used by researchers, policymakers, and security agencies to gain insights for decision-making and policy formulation.

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any suggestions, enhancements, or additional analysis ideas, please feel free to submit a pull request.
